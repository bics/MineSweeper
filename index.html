            <p>Minesweeper is a logic puzzle video game genre generally played on personal computers. The game features a grid of clickable tiles, with hidden "mines"
                (depicted as naval mines in the original game) dispersed throughout the board. The objective is to clear the board without detonating any mines,
                with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. </p>
            <p>Variants of Minesweeper have been made that expand on the basic concepts, such as Minesweeper X, Crossmines, and Minehunt. Minesweeper has been incorporated as a minigame
                 in other games, such as RuneScape and Minecraft's 2015 April Fools update. </p>
            <p>The origin of Minesweeper is unclear. According to TechRadar, the first version of the game was 1990's Microsoft Minesweeper,
                but Eurogamer states Mined-Out (1983) by Ian Andrew was the first Minesweeper game. Curt Johnson, the creator of Microsoft Minesweeper,
                acknowledges that his game's design was borrowed from another game, but denies that it was Mined-Out.
